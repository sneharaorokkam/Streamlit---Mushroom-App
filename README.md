# Building a Machine Learning Web App with Streamlit and Python

This project aims at leveraging the power of Python and Streamlit to develop an interactive machine learning web application.

Streamlit is a powerful, open-source Python library that enables developers to create beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science without any need for front-end experience. With its simplicity and flexibility, this project provides an engaging way to display machine learning models.

## Overview
This project encapsulates building a web-based application to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous. It utilizes a variety of classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, from the widely used Python library, scikit-learn. The beauty of this project lies in its interactivity. Users can not only choose the type of algorithm they want to use for classification but can also tweak the hyperparameters in real-time and witness the change in performance.

The application built in this project provides visualizations of evaluation metrics for binary classification algorithms, offering a clear understanding of the model's performance. It's built to be user-friendly, providing a great deal of flexibility to interact with the data and the machine learning models.

## Project Objectives
* To build an interactive web application with Streamlit and Python.
* To train various classifiers including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifiers using scikit-learn.
* To create visual plots of evaluation metrics for binary classification algorithms.

## Viewing the Application
Explore the Web App.

Upon opening the link, you'll be greeted by a user-friendly interface that lets you interact with various machine learning models. The app enables you to explore the data used, select a classification algorithm of your choice, and dynamically adjust hyperparameters. These features allow you to observe in real-time how different configurations impact the model's performance.

Built with Streamlit, the application provides a highly interactive platform that bridges the gap between machine learning and web development. It's designed to be self-explanatory, but don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback.
